# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code doesn't introduce new code quality violations. Use [Sonarqube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) with the default profile.
6. Issue that pull request!

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers at [opensource@endava.com](opensource@endava.com) if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use JetBrains's IntelliJ's default C# coding style. In summary:

- indent with 4 spaces
- 120 characters line length

And also please consider to:
- run a ```mvn sonar:sonar``` to check for code quality violations
